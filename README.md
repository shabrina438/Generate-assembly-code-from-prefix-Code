# Generate-assembly-code-from-prefix-Code
 Computer Architecture Project

Project Descripton:
The main purpose of the code is to show the assembly code of the given prefix code. That means
the user have to input the prefix code as, *XY and by running our code the output will be like â€“
PUSH X
PUSH Y
MUL
So, our code will convert the prefix code to its assembly code form and show it. We used C++
programing language for doing this.
